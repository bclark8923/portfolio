            <p>My latest startup is called HDP Health. We built AI technology that could read structured and un-structured medical record data and automatically identify patients for clinical trials. We worked with various healthcare providers and pharmacetucial companies to speed up the pace of bringing new revolutionary medical treatments to market faster.</p>

            </div>
            <p>For another Hackathon project I created an application to replace business cards. It was extremely simple and all it did was when you met someone, you would pull out your phone, insert their email and the location/event you were at and it would send a pre-baked email "Great to meet you at EVENT, we should connect for coffee soon." Up until iOS 11 I used this app whenever I met someone to avoid losing the business card and never following up.</p>

            <p>A friend and I co-foudned LinkTexting, a javascript plugin anyone can drop on their website to add a text box where a user on a laptop can enter their phone number and it will text a mobile app download to their phone.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We then built GrowAmp, a tool that scraped the iTunes and Google Play app stores as well as other services that had a list of newly launched mobile applications for contact information. We utilized this list to find customers for LinkTexting and sold the lists to other vendors.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This company and their products were acquired in September 2016 and are still running today.</p>

            <p>For the 2014 Salesforce Hackathon a team of three of us built a mobile application for sales reps to better utilize Salesforce. We took 2nd place for a prize of $50k. The other two members went on to found a company based on the idea.</p>

            <p>Vue was created when we added automatic error tracking to a previous application called AnnoTree's plugin for mobile apps.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We then began pulling usage and device analytics and added the ability to have customer conversations directly in app for mobile application developers. Nearly 50 mobile applications utilized this service.</p>

            <p>For the 2013 Salesforce hackathon a group of us built a fitness application where you could recite the current workout you just completed such as "I did 3 sets of 5 reps of bench press at 225 lbs" and it would automatically track your workout progress.</p>

            </div>
            <p>This was my first ever hackathon and I loved it. I built a super simple application for guys who needed a last minute gift for their girlfriend/wife. The application would show common gifts and the listed price was pre-calculated price to include tax and overnight/same-day shipping so you knew exactly what you were paying to get it ASAP. It was based on the Sears/Kmart API and I ended up winning "Most Unique Idea" with a prize of $5,000.</p>

            <p>This was my first full time startup project. As an IT Product Manager at GE, and building iOS games on my own on the side, I came up with a product where web/mobile developers would have a plugin where users could annotate directly on the screen to note any bugs or feedback on the product at hand. The plugin would then send the annotated screenshot directly into a project management tool for the product developers to use to improve their product.</p>

            <p>During my two years at GE this was my all time favorite project. I worked with a small team to design, develop and deploy a Business Intelligence solution for internal teams at GE's Corporate Tax division. This system was version 2 of the Tax Report Generator and was built for users to be able to run business reports without the help of IT staff.</p>

            <p>For my last project at college I created a tilt based arcade game for iPhone called Fireballin' where you tilted a ball around the screen and dodged an ever increasing number of fireballs.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            After graduating I changed the game into Radia where I created a 60 level game with three arcade modes and global leaderboards, designing all of the graphics and building all of the code myself utilizing the Cocos2D Framework and worked with my brother to create custom music. I reached nearly 200,000 total players over ~6 months.</p>

            <p>For my University of Michigan Game Design Senior Project three of us built a super smash brothers clone. We had 8 characters, 15 levels, and every player had a completely unique moveset.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            We filmed a group of our friends in costumes in front of a green screen and then chopped them into sprites to create the characters for our game. For playing we programmed various button combinations to execute attacks, this would then draw from XML sheets with animation frames, damage vectors, timing, etc. to allow us to rapidly create various unique moves and attacks for every character.</p>

            <p>This was the first video game I ever made from scratch (code, pixel art, sounds, etc.). It was a top down 2D shooter where light was of importance. You could only see within a small circle around you as you neared enemies they would scream and charge at you. There were 15 levels and an endless monsters arcade mode.</p>

            <p>This was my first ever real application. I took EECS 481 Software Engineering as a Junior at University of Michigan and this class opened my eyes to the world of real software development. I worked as the project manager leading a team of 5 of us to design, develop and deploy a web application built on the CakePHP framework to facilite class registration for a summer camp in Michigan. By the end we launched software they could use to create classes, sign up students, and manage itineraries for their entire camp of thousands of students</p>
